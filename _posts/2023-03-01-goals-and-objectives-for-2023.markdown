Happy New Year fellow Internet travelers!

First of all, I would like to wish a wonderful and prosperity 2023 to y'all.

I'll write a little bit about my goals and objectives for 2023.

My objectives for 2023 is to obtain more knowledge about linux, containers and cloud computing.
And to accomplish this, I'll do through certifications preparations, and if possible, schedule for the exams to earn the following certications:

1. LPIC-1:
    + I'll divide the two exams between 1 month and a half of preparation, totalizing 3 months of study/preparations to accomplish the certification. The first one 101, I'll try to do in the first half of February, and the second one 102 in the beginning of May.

2. DCA:
    + Using the rest of first semester (May and June) to prepare/study and schedule for Docker Certified Assoaciate exam for July.

3. CKA:
    + Certified Kubernetes Assoaciate, the study and preparations will be in the second semester, using the July and August months to gain enough knowledge for the exam in the begining of September.

4. AWS SAA:
    + AWS Solution Architect: Associate, gonna use the rest of the year (between September, October and the first half of November) to prepare and schedule the exam for the second half of November.

And that't it! :rocket:

I hope I do not get overwhelmed and accomplish all of them. Between the study/preparations for the above cited exams, I'll do posts right here to y'all follow it.
